# spike_sorting_CNN
Code for CNN-t and CNN-s in Multi-Channel Many-Class Real-time Neural Spike Sorting with Convolutional Neural Networks

xdata_64 and ydata_64 is a synthetic data from [1].
data for CNN-s is not avaliable in public, so only the code for the model is shared.

conda_env_clean.yaml is the export of conda environment used for the codes
